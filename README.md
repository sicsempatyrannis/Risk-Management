# Risk-Management
Calculates risk metrics


1.) Run the risk_assessment_class.py file as an executable within the folder. It will generate several risk metrics.
	Scenario: Already lent £40,000,000 with £10,000,000 commited. These values can be altered inside the program.
	
	
2.) Run the logic.py file as executable and enter the Iwoca company number when prompted (because they are Iwoca's risk metrics used).

3.) There should be an image generated showing a heat map of officers and their appointments, with all the risk metrics at the bottom.

IF you want to run the prorgams for another company you will need to download their company financials from companycheck.co.uk.
Also need to change the company value listed in risk_assessment_class.py.

Tested the logic program to different depths and any depth greater than one caused the graph generated to be too large to be visually
useful. Can edit the depth in the program.

*** Programs must be executed in that order ***
